# MaskLRNet: Rethinking the Design of Lightweight CNNs with Decomposed Convolutions

"A lightweight convolutional neural network for edge computing environments, achieving high-accuracy object detection with low computational cost."

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

**ImageNet-1K (ILSVRC2012)** 
**COCO 2017** 




MaskLRNet is not limited to image classification. To comprehensively evaluate its effectiveness, 
we conduct experiments on three representative vision tasks:
- **Image Classification** (ImageNet-1K): validating recognition performance.  
- **Object Detection** (COCO): testing localization and detection accuracy.  
- **Instance Segmentation** (COCO): assessing fine-grained pixel-level understanding.
